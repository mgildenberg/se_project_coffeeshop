# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- The designed layout is not useful for a cafe/restaurant. The recipes video section is ahead of more important conversion opportunities like table booking and important menu information. I would put the recipes section after the menu or not have it at all.
- If I still had a recipes section, I'd change iframe player controls + ensure no related Youtube videos are suggested after the embedded one is played.
- I made this to match the brief's design but it's not logical/fair to ask someone to agree to terms after a button. I would move the checkbox to before the button.
- I don't think it's a good design choice to have the last menu section centered. I'd rather this be 3 columns instead.
- The animations here don't engage or add meaning, they are just part of the brief's design. I'd remove the current pulsate animation and instead add some kind of gradient shine or similar animation to point users to booking a table which is the point of a restaurant/cafe website.
- The design's prices omit zeros after the decimal point so $1.50 becomes $1.5. I'd prefer to keep the zeros.
