# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Improve the way the y in library (header title) appears over the image (when the site is seen at 1400px wide)
- Consider changing header image to relative positioning instead of absolute in order to change z-index value
- Remove bottom margins from recipe video captions
- Change iframe player controls
